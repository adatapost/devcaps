# DevCaps: Plugin to auto-correct the caps of programming language names

## Description
WordPress plugin to auto-correct the capitalization of programming language/library/framework names, cause they can get pretty weird.

## Technology
It's a WordPress Plugin, so... PHP.

## Progress
Just starting. All the plugin headings and license are set up, the cap_program_name function is working in the correct filter, so I am going to work on the function content next.
